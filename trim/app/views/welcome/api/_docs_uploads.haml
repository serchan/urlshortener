%h3== #{word_picim} Upload and Sharing Process via the API
%p<
  ==Uploading a photo to #{word_picim} for your users is a three step process: 1) you upload a photo to #{word_picim} to get a URL for it; 2) you send the tweet directly to Twitter for your user; and 3) you send us a copy of the tweet and its related information so that we can display it right away on the #{word_picim} viewing page with the image.

  ==This has a number of advantages. First, we do not need to see the user's Twitter password and send the tweet for them, and you do not need to transfer this password to us in the clear. You can keep that information secure and unknown to us, if you have it. Secondly, <i>you</i> submit the status update with your software and take credit for it on Twitter. And most importantly, it supports OAuth from beginning to end. You can submit the tweet with the photo's URL on the user's behalf with an OAuth authorization, and then simply send us a copy of it. <i>No one</i> needs to see the Twitter user's password. No other social network-focused photo sharing website offers this end-to-end process, that we are aware of.
